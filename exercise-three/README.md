# Exercise Three

Exercise Three consists of three services.

All of the services are in the `exercise-three` namespace.

The three services are all currently **down** and it's your job to fix them!

You **do not** need to fix app code to solve this exercise, use _only_ the `kubectl` and `helm` commands we've discussed in the workshop!

## The User Service

The user service is current **down**!

```bash
curl localhost/exercise-three/user
```

This should return a list of users! But it's not working!

Dive into the cluster with `kubectl` and `helm` to figure out what's wrong!

Once this service is up:

```bash
curl localhost/exercise-three/user
```

should return a list of users!

## The Invoice Service

The invoice service was supposedly deployed to the cluster, but for some reason it's not there?

Check out the cluster to see what happened!

Once this service is up:

```bash
curl localhost/exercise-three/invoices
```

should return a list of invoices!

## The Download Service

The download service was deployed but the deployment failed! ðŸ˜±

Look for the pods in the cluster and see if you can figure out what happened!

Once this service is up:

```bash
curl localhost/exercise-three/download
```

should return a CSV of invoices!

## Hints

- Use `kubectl get pods` to see what pods are running

- Use `helm ls` to see what helm releases are installed

- Use `helm history <release-name>` to see the history of a helm release

- Use `helm ls --pending` to see what helm releases are pending
